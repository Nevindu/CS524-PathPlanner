    "This project is inspired by our work as members of Wisconsin Autonomous student organization. We are part of a university team competing in the AutoDrive Challenge II competition organized by SAE International and General Motors. The goal of this competition is to build a self-driving car capable of navigating urban environmets.\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of the control stack of the self driving car  there are three planners: 1) The High Level planner which creates a set of target waypoints to follow, 2) The Mid Level planner which generates a smooth trajectory from the waypoints and 3) A Low Level planner, which uses a feedback control algorithm to generate a target velocity and heading which is then passed into the vehicle as a throttle and a steering input.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we plan to adress the trajectory optimization problem of the Mid Level planner of the Wisconsin Autonomous control stack. The theoretical foundation for our work will be based on the work done by University of Toronto during the previous iteration of the competition (AutoDrive Challenge I) (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.coma/doi/full/10.1002/rob.21958). \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to generate a path $P = [\\mathbf{X_1}...\\mathbf{X_N}]$, from the way points generated from the High Level planner, $x_i = [x_i \\quad y_i \\quad \\theta_i]$, where $\\theta_i$ is the heading angle at way point $i$.\n",
